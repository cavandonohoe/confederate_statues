The Commission also found unanimously that the Capitol monuments are ""an overrepresentation and over-memorialization"" of the Confederacy and Civil War in North Carolina. The Commission urged the state’s Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to plan and raise money for a monument recognizing the contributions of African Americans to North Carolina's history.[5] On June 19, 2020, the two statues at the base of the monument were toppled by protestors.
